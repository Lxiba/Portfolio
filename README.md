# 🌋 Laiba Asif — Personal Portfolio

**A fiery, immersive portfolio built with Next.js, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS**

## What Is This?

This is my personal portfolio — a fully hand-crafted, single-page application designed around a **lava and fire aesthetic**. Every section has been built with intention: volcano video backgrounds, GPU-rendered meteor particle systems, draggable project carousels, and smooth scroll-reveal animations that make the whole thing feel alive.

It's not just a portfolio. It's a demonstration of the kind of work I can do.

## Sections at a Glance

| Section | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Hero** | Full-screen volcano eruption video backdrop with staggered entrance animations |
| **Introduction** | Profile, resume/LinkedIn/GitHub links, and an animated meteor icon list |
| **Education** | Alternating timeline layout (desktop) / stacked (mobile) with glowing cards |
| **Inventory** | Skill grid split into Programming, Frameworks & Libraries, and Tools — each icon wrapped in a fire-ring border |
| **Projects** | Horizontally draggable carousel of 10 projects with click-to-open modals and per-project detail panels |
| **Contact** | Lava-video backdrop, FormSubmit-powered contact form with success/error states |

## Features

- **3D Meteor Shower** — An instanced mesh particle system (50 meteors) rendered via `@react-three/fiber`, with per-particle lifecycle management, color lerping from `#FF4500` → `#8B0000`, and gravity simulation
- **Video Backgrounds** — Three distinct compressed video assets across Hero, Projects, and Contact, each with low-opacity overlays for readability
- **Draggable Project Carousel** — Horizontal scroll with drag-detection threshold; a clean drag vs. click distinction to open modals
- **Project Modals** — Portal-rendered overlays per project, animated with Motion (scale + fade), keyboard-dismissible via `Escape`
- **Scroll Reveal Animations** — A reusable `ScrollReveal` wrapper component supporting directional entry (up / down / left / right) with configurable delay and threshold
- **Responsive Education Timeline** — Completely different layouts for desktop (2-col alternating with center line) and mobile (single-col, left-aligned)
- **Glassmorphism Navbar** — Transparent on load, gains a frosted-glass background on scroll, with an animated hamburger menu for mobile

## Design System

The entire portfolio follows a **lava and fire** theme — dark reds, burnt oranges, and glowing embers against a near-black background.

```
Background:   #0A0000  (near-black)
Surface:      #1A0505 / #2A0A0A
Text:         #FFF0E0  (warm cream) / #FFD4B0 (warm orange)
Accent:       #FF4500  (orange-red) / #CC3700 / #8B0000 (deep red)
Highlight:    #FFD700  (gold) / #FF8C00
```

**Custom CSS utilities defined in `globals.css`:**
- `.lava-text` — gradient text with glow `drop-shadow`
- `.fire-shadow` — layered orange/red `box-shadow` glow
- `.fire-circle-border` — pulsing fire ring around skill icons
- `.glass` — `backdrop-blur` glassmorphism panel
- `.box-texture` — subtle background texture for cards
- `.animate-carousel` — infinite CSS scroll animation (40s loop)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-portfolio.git
cd personal-portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it locally.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` at the root:

```env
# Optional — only needed if you switch to Web3Forms for the contact form
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_KEY=your_key_here
```

The contact form currently uses [FormSubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/) and requires no API key.

---

## Deployment

This portfolio is deployed on **Vercel**. To deploy your own fork:

1. Push the repo to GitHub
2. Import it into [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
3. Vercel auto-detects Next.js — no extra config needed
4. Add any environment variables in the Vercel dashboard

---

## Performance Notes

- Three.js canvas: `antialias: false`, `dpr` clamped to `[1, 1.5]` to stay smooth on high-DPI screens without burning GPU
- `MeteorShowerWrapper` uses `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` to keep Three.js off the server render
- Video assets are pre-compressed and served from `/public/assets/`
- Next.js `<Image>` with `priority` used for above-the-fold images
- Scroll reveal uses `IntersectionObserver` under the hood (via Motion) — no scroll event listeners hammering the main thread
